# Audio-Technica Watchlist

Just want a turntable from Audio Technica but it's not often in stock on their outlet store so I wrote this to keep an eye on it for me.

This can be used for any products on the Audio Technica outlet page. Just clone this down and add your discord webhook to the environment variable in the docker-compose, then add any product names you'd like the bot to watch for you to the watchlist.txt file.
